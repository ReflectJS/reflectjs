Reflect.js is a reactive web server and framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the browser.

It's an [Express](https://expressjs.com) application for Node.js which processes and serves HTML extending its capabilities in both the server and the client.

It turns HTML into a reactive language for creating dynamic web apps, made of reusable components, that are still fully indexable out of the box.
